# ðŸ›’ Shopping Platform

#### A shopping service that manages products and calculates prices based on configurable discount policies.

---

## ðŸš€ How to Build, Run, and Test

### Requirements

- Java 21
- Docker
- Gradle (wrapper included in the project: `./gradlew`)

---

### Build the Application

```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

This command:

- Compiles the source code,
- Generates MapStruct mappers,
- Runs all unit and integration tests (including Testcontainers-based tests).

---

### Run the Application

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

This command starts the application on port 8080.

### Run the Application with Docker (Buildpacks)

To create a production-ready Docker image and run it:

```bash
./gradlew bootBuildImage
```

This command builds the application and creates a Docker image named `shopping-platform:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`
The image is built using Spring Boot Buildpacks (no custom Dockerfile needed).

To run the Docker image:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 ala-shopping-platform:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT
```

This command runs the application in a Docker container, exposing it on port 8080.

---

### Run Tests

```bash
./gradlew test
```

Tests include:
â€¢ Unit tests
â€¢ Integration tests using Testcontainers with a PostgreSQL database.

Docker must be running for integration tests to work properly.

## Testing with Testcontainers

The integration tests use Testcontainers to spin up a PostgreSQL database dynamically.
No manual setup is required â€” Docker must be installed and running.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.4.4
- MapStruct â€” DTO mapping
- Testcontainers â€” PostgreSQL integration tests
- OpenAPI (Swagger UI)
- Gradle â€” build tool
- Docker Buildpacks â€” for containerization without Dockerfile
- Lombok â€” for reducing boilerplate code
- JUnit 5 â€” for unit and integration testing
- Mockito â€” for mocking dependencies in tests
- PostgreSQL â€” for the database

---

### Project Structure

Application structure follows the principles of Clean ( Hexagonal ) Architecture , separating concerns into different
layers:

```plaintext
ala-shopping-platform/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/main/java
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ com/zen/ala
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ application/         # Application services
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ domain/              # Business domain model
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure/      # Persistence, web API, configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ src/test/java
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ com/zen/ala              # Unit and integration tests
â”œâ”€â”€ build.gradle                 # Gradle build file
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                    # Project documentation
â””â”€â”€ Dockerfile (generated via Buildpacks)
```

## ðŸ“š API Documentation

The API documentation is available at `/swagger-ui/index.html` after starting the application.

### API Endpoints
